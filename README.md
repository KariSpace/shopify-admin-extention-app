# Shopify App Template - Remix

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using the [Remix](https://remix.run) framework. This app allows users to efficiently manage and track orders, view and resolve unresolved issues, and receive notifications about pending issues directly within the app.

## Features

- **Order Management**: Efficiently manage and track orders with real-time updates.
- **Issue Tracking**: View and resolve unresolved issues related to orders.
- **User Notifications**: Get notified about pending issues directly within the app.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

## Usage

### Navigating the App

- **Home**: Overview of your orders and their statuses.
- **Additional Page**: Additional resources and links for users.
- **Issue Tracker**: Detailed view of unresolved issues for each order.

### API Integration

#### Fetching Order Issues

Hereâ€™s how to fetch order issues using the Admin API:

```javascript
const fetchOrderIssues = async (orderId) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/order/${orderId}/issues`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: Ensure your API keys are correctly set in the environment variables.
- **Data Fetching Errors**: Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools for any failed requests.
